<p> Public health issues often present a spatial problem that requires assertion of control over private spaces and individuals.  The nature of communicable disease is that it spreads through direct contact or bodily secretions, and thus the first victims of epidemics are often populations that live in crowded, impoverished, and unsanitary conditions. In fulfilling their mission, public health officials inevitably encounter people who are at least partially defined by their social identities: minorities, immigrants, and the poor.  The subsequent language of differentiating the risk groups for disease can overlap, or even embrace, racialized assumptions that encourage political and social discrimination. Michael Willrich’s *Pox* and Natalia Molina’s *Fit to Be Citizens* examine these sort of public health encounters from a social history and cultural studies perspective, respectively.</p>
<p>Willrich tackles racialization of public health as a by-product of limited knowledge. Scientific understanding of smallpox transmission at the time was that contagion through fomites (contaminated objects) was more virulent than face-to-face respiratory transmission, which created perception of smallpox as a “filth” disease.  While fomite infection does occur, this “long-standing association of smallpox with the filthy poor was grounded more in class and racial bias than in (today’s) medical reality.” [Willrich, 349] Crowded living conditions of the poor presented the danger, less so the clutter within.</p>
<p>Public health officials casually expressed, and espoused, the prevailing racist and class sentiments of their day; repellent as those views are to the contemporary reader, Willrich assesses the operational response to the smallpox outbreaks to have been based on sound science of the time:
 <blockquote>To dismiss official accounts out of hand – or to read them only as elite ideology – is to forgo all hope of recovering the social experience of disease. The wonderfully idiosyncratic epistolary form that public health reports took in the era inspires at least some confidence in their contents….Even assuming broad agreement regarding matters of race and class, it would have taken a racial conspiracy of an implausible scale to make all of these reports tell a common story of the epidemic’s prevalence among African Americans and poor whites, if there were not some basis for this in fact… Public health officials made a revealing leap, however, when they concluded that (the victims) were  morally culpable for the spread of smallpox.  [Willrich, 98]</blockquote>
<p>In *Fit to Be Citizens*, epidemiology as a subject is subordinated to a closer examination of the biases of public officials and their political weaponization of medical data. Molina’s approach to the question of racialization is a deep dive into the narrow geography and fragmented, nigh inscrutable, archives of Los Angeles County, California. Her study is important because it moves outside the familiar black-white binary that dominates racial discourse in the United States; Los Angeles County had a miniscule African American population during this period, while Mexicans, Chinese, Japanese, and poor whites competed for position within a racial hierarchy. [Molina, 6-7] The extent to which the "sound science" of the time accepted and perpetuated racial stereotypes is illustrated by official documents depicting the Chinese as disease carriers (not the conditions in which they lived), and asserting that Mexicans “shunned water, ...typhus was uniquely Mexican,”  and Japanese birth rates were a “yellow peril." [Molina, pp. 26, 69, 91]</p>
<p><b>Defining Race:</b> Race identity in the United States is a social construct that typically places “whiteness” as the standard against which other racial identities are defined. However, Eric Goldstein observes in <i>The Price of Whiteness: Jews, Race, and American Identity</i> that the “…black-white racial dichotomy has functioned in American history less as an accurate description of social reality than as an ideology.”[Goldstein, 3] Instead of this binary, whiteness was understood in practice as a continuum of racial groups who could make increasing claims on whiteness and thus candidacy for full inclusion in American culture. Goldstein disagrees with scholars who “posit a fairly uncomplicated embrace of whiteness by immigrant groups... (and that) such ambiguity was quickly resolved as immigrants responded to overwhelming dominance of the black-white paradigm.” [Goldstein, 4]  Molina also rejects this binary, at least insofar as the population of Los Angeles, CA during her period of study.  She writes of the “…notion of race as a graded continuum shading from white, at the top, downward through various forms of “nonwhite,” represented by the city’s Chinese, Japanese, and Mexican populations. [Molina, 6] She subscribes to the construct described by Claire Jean Kim in Bitter Fruit: The Politics of Black-Korean Conflict in New York City that thinks of racial ordering 
<blockquote> …not as a single-scale hierarchy (A over B over C) but as a field structured by at least two axes: that of superior/inferior and that of insider/foreigner. Blacks and Whites constitute the major anchors (bottom and top, respectively) of this order, and incoming immigrants and other groups get positioned relative to these two loci.” [Kim, 10] </blockquote>
Kim’s construct is intriguing, but difficult to visualize across a corpus. Texts that discuss racial constructs usually do not stop to say, for example, “A is superior to B, except when C is present. D and B are similarly superior, but B is considered more foreign.” A typical example from an early 20th century legal treatise illustrates the challenge of fleshing out Kim’s racial axes:
<blockquote>Jews, especially Russian Jews, often become frantic with terror after an accident and develop many secondary nervous phenomena. Negroes suffer considerably from fear, being usually very emotional. Warbasse (2) reminds us that the negro, as seen in temperate climates, is less resistant to disease and injury than are the whites, and the death-rate among them is higher at all ages. The same author cautions us to bear in mind that the skull of the African negro is much thicker than that of the white. He says that mulattoes or mixed breeds present the weaknesses of both races and more deficient resistance than either. Warbasse (3) also states that the Jewish people bear surgical operations well; and that injuries and operations are borne particularly well by the people who live exclusively, or nearly so, on a vegetable diet-the Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Mohammedans, and the peasantry of Europe. [Document_id:20004268501, Legal Medicine and Toxicology, 1926] </blockquote>

<p><b>Keyword search for racial ordering:</b>  One approach to this challenge would be to manually search a set of documents for key words and build some sort of table that counts instances of use, perhaps qualifying them with a grading scheme for the context in which they were applied. Such a system has several vulnerabilities. First, the search terms would have to be defined by the user and rely upon serendipitous discovery [Putnam, 386-387] to add forgotten or unfamiliar terms. Second, manually assessing racial ordering against a growing number of contexts would be subject to the biases of the person doing the grading and an increasing rate of error. As Laura Putnam warns, “….historians tend to attribute causality to what we see, without formal modeling to act as a brake on our tendency to do so.” [Putnam, 390] Operations research methods could assist with this interpretation, but the database upon which such methods rely would still be vulnerable to these limitations. </p>

<p><b>A digital history approach:</b> This paper examines how racial ordering may reveal itself through distant reading techniques applied to a corpus of legal treatises.  The source for this test is the Making of Modern Law database which contains 22,000 US and British legal treatises published from 1800-1926. [FN database] A subset of 123 medical jurisprudence texts was selected as a corpus that likely contained similar intellectual thought and resources with public health officials. </p>

<p><b>*A note on racial terminology and ordering in this essay:</b> the language of racial identity during the period under study is minutely detailed, contains discredited science, and is often deeply offensive in today's society. The use of such taxonomies in this paper reflect racial perceptions as expressed by the texts themselves and do not represent the personal beliefs of the author. The terms used in external analysis of those taxonomies adopt the usage expressed by Goldstein, Kim, Molina, and Willrich.*</p>

<p>The strategy for revealing racial ordering involves three steps: 1) creation of racial taxonomies, 2) measurement of racial identity according to those taxonomies, 3) creation of a comparison scales to replicate Kim's construct.</p>

<p><b>Step 1: Building Taxonomies of Racial Terms:</b></p>
<p>The corpus of medical jurisprudence .txt files were read into R and processed using the wordVectors package to create a word embedded model (WEM). [FN - Schmidt] Word embedded models measure spatial relationships between words, which enables examination of these relationships on the basis of their nearness (similarity) or distance (less similarity.)</p>
<p>An advantage of building a WEM is that the analyst does not have to rely on a trial and error process of keyword searches to identify a set of related terms. As previously noted, Keyword searches are at risk of being incomplete, inaccurate because of changes in usage, or biased by contemporary sensibilities. In the WEM, the terms are suggested by spatial relationships between the words themselves.By iteratively modeling terms "nearest_to" a set of general "seed" labels ("race", "races", "racial"), an inclusive list of overall racial terms was created. This set was used to build the seed terms for individual racial groups and further modeling. As new terms were identified for a specific group, they were added back into the overall racial terms list. </p>

<p>The modeling process required some decisions about inclusion of certain types of words. When modeling for racial terms, the model quickly begins to include religion and geographic locations. For example, "Jew" refers to both race and religion; I included it in the list because the Jewish people are often treated as a race during this period. More generic terms, such as "ethnic" are included because they typically refer to people viewed as "other." Geographic terms were excluded if they could not also apply to a group of people, i.e., "germany" was excuded, but "germanic" was included. Lastly, anthropological terms such as "australoid" and "mongoloid" were largely excluded from the term sets, although they appear in the nearest_to modeling results. After much back and forth with the models, "caucasian" and "negroid" were included because they appear to have entered non-anthropological vernacular to a significant degree.</p>

<p>The racial taxonomies for the medical jurisprudence texts are as follows: 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print("All racial terms")
readRDS("mjp_all_terms.RDS")
```
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print ("Asian terms")
readRDS("mjp_asian_terms.RDS")
```
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print("Black terms")
readRDS("mjp_black_terms.RDS")
```
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print("European terms")
readRDS("mjp_european_terms.RDS")
```
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print("Hispanic terms")
readRDS("mjp_hispanic_terms.RDS")
```
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print("Jewish terms")
readRDS("mjp_jewish_terms.RDS") 
```
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print("White terms")
readRDS("mjp_white_terms.RDS") 
```
<p>
Comparison of these taxonomies point to a defintion of "whiteness" by what it *is not* versus what *it is* (caucasian and anglo-saxon). Likewise, Jewishness as a race is referred to alternatively only as "hebrew" and "tribes".  Racial identity for other groups is (not particularly surprisingly) based on points of origin, color, and religion. With this in mind, examination of sample texts suggest that direct reference to "whiteness" is usually assocated with forensic identification or in anthropological comparison to other races (eg. caucasion vs australoid). Otherwise, individuals are identified by those terms that make them less-white.
</p>


<p><b>Step 2:</b> The next step was to apply nearest_to modeling to each racial taxonomy to create vector sets of the 150 words closest to each. For example, the white racial vector was created thus:
  <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
    white_terms <- c("caucasian",  "saxons", "anglo")
races_white = nearest_to(model,model[[white_terms]],150)

  </div>
resulting in a set of 150 associated words similar to this shortened sample:</p>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
readRDS("mjp_races_white_nearest_to_sample.RDS")
```
<p>After calculating cosine similarity for each vector, I experimented with plotting the race vectors in pairs.  The Asian versus White Vector plot is a typical example of the results:
)</p>
  <div id="bg">
  <img src="C:/Users/Kim/Documents/Text Analysis for Historians/moml/moml_final_project/asian_vs_white_cosineimilarities.png" alt="">
   <div id="bg">
 
</div> 


<p>
The words in this plot do not  define "asian" or "white"and the dividing line should not be interpreted as placing a particular word in one category or the other. The plot is a comparison of how similar each word is to "asian" or "white", placing two sets of terms in tension with each other as a binary that does not exist in reality. This "binary" plot pulls in identities associated with multiple identities, supporting the concept that racial identity in practice is defined along a continuum. 
</p>

<p></b>Step 3:</b>Having created taxonomies and vector sets for each racial group, the final step was to create a pair of scales that aligned with Kim's construct: "...a field structured by at least two axes: that of superior/inferior and that of insider/foreigner. Blacks and Whites constitute the major anchors (bottom and top, respectively) of this order, and incoming immigrants and other groups get positioned relative to these two loci.” [Kim, 10] The black/white scale was easy enough to create, but the insider/foreigner scale required a little more thought. After some trial and error, the scale was created by subtracting the all_races vector from the white vector. After testing the scale on three text subsets from the MOML corpus, the scale appears to be stable.  </p>
<p>Graphing racial terms against this pair of scales reveals racial ordering of all groups as it exists within the corpus:</p>
<div id="bg">
  <img src="mjp_race_scales.jpg" alt="">
</div>  
```{r}

#![](mjp_race_scales.jpg)
```
<p><b>Interpreting the Racial Ordering Scale Graph:</b> 
The graph represents ordering of racial terms in relation to each other in multi-dimensional space. The absolute numerical positioning of a particular term is less important than its nearness or distance from another. One can see at a glance, for example, that "arabs" are perceived as more foreign than, but superior to "italians."  Visualization of these spatial relationships provides an intuitive interface for identifying historical questions.</p>
<p><b>Case Studies:</b></p>
<p>1. Caucasian/Australoid pair: These terms float far to the right on the Insider scale and exist in close proximity. The term "australoid" appears solely in a 1907 treatise, *MEDICO-LEGAL INSPECTIONS AND POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS* [document_id 20001902501] It is used five times in discourse devoted to anatomical characteristics that assist in forensic identification of a corpse. "Caucasian" appears in 21 documents (17% of the corpus) and is used in the context of forensic analysis and determination of the race of offspring. The sensitivity of the model to the term "australoid" raises confidence in the completeness of the results.
</p>
<p>2. 

<p>Where are the Irish?</>
<p>The term "irish" did not arise during any of the modeling.  This is surprising, given their large scale immigration to the United States during this period and their history as "less white" than other groups.  A model of the term explains why: "irish" does appear in the texts, but not in significant relation to other racial terms *at this scale*.  When the subset of medical jurisprudence texts after 1899 was modeled, "irish" appeared as a European term.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
readRDS("mjp_irish.RDS", 10)
